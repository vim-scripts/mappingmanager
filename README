actions speak louder than words, so check out this demo:

(

PROBLEM
=======
First there was a happy vim-user, but after some vim plugins, 
lots of tricks'n'commands: the vim-user begins to suffer from braindamage.
Keyboardshortcuts are easier to remember, but in vim also its very
easy to get a 'almost-all-my-mappings-are-taken' syndrome.

SOLUTION
========
switching of keyboardmappings..you can have endless mappings now.
Call it keyboardshortcutsmappings or presets if you will.


USAGE 
======
- use ,m to toggle a mappingmanager-panel which gives LOT of info
- use ,, to cycle thru mappings (remembering this shortcut is enough, rest is self-explanatory)
- [optional] use ,. to view the current mapping
- [optional] use ,/ to select a mapping
- [optional] use ,m change output mode between 'dialog' or 'console'
- [optional] use ,F1 select mapping #1
- [optional] use ,F2 select mapping #2
- ..and so on
